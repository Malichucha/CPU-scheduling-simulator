CPU Scheduling Simulator
Java | GUI
A desktop application built using Java and Swing to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, SJF Non-Preemptive, Priority Non-Preemptive, and SJF Preemptive. The application allows users to input process parameters like arrival time, burst time, and priority, and visualizes the scheduling process with a Gantt chart. It also calculates and displays the average waiting and turnaround times for each algorithm.
